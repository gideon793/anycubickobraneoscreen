# Using the Anycubic Kobra Neo screen with Klipper

## Using a Raspberry Pi4 as the host

Flash the SD card using Mainsail OS

Wire the pi to the Screen as described in this repository: https://github.com/jokubasver/Anycubic-Kobra-Go-Neo-LCD-Driver/

__Note that the order of the pins properly. I spent a whole day with the order reversed because the image is of the connector to the printer mainboard__
